# Bloomberg Server API Demo
This is a simple C# console app to demo the use of the Bloomberg Server API on Microsoft Windows.

This may also work with desktop API if you have a Bloomberg terminal.

If you don't have a Bloomberg Terminal, you'll need four things to get this working:

- [ ] A C# compiler and net7.0 installed.
- [ ] The Bloomberg API libraries (Bloomberg.Blpapi) from Bloomberg website.
- [ ] A Bloomberg SAPI license (and assorted hardware infrastructure).
- [ ] The hostname or IP address of your Bloomberg server (or *localhost* if you do have a Bloomberg terminal).
